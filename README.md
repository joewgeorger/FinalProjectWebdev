Aproved by Jason Ren

This project has tw main webpages, a user page and employee page. Each have different privliges and functionality. Users can see ther previous orders and send in new orders. Employees can see all orders and create new employees. There is also a user sign up and login/logout pages. This was acheived through using react, express, and mongoDB. My 10 point creative protion in theuse of different packages inside node.js and react. These packages were: concurrently(which allowed me to run react and the sever at the same time with one comand), cors( made it easier to send data between the front and backend), mongoose(which was used to make querys to mongodb), and react-router-dom(allowed multiple webpages to be run on the same root). Learn the functionality of these different packages was useful to the project and should also fill the creative requirements.
